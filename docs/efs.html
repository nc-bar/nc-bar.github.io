<p>The simplest mechanism providing access control in Unix operating systems uses file permissions
and users. Files have owners, both groups and users, and a set of permissions.
For example:</p>

<pre><code>d-rwxr-xr-x M 0 ncb ncb      0 Aug  6 12:24 forth
d-rwxr-xr-x M 0 ncb ncb      0 Aug  3 23:03 groff
--rw-r--r-- M 0 ncb ncb   1596 Jul 31 18:11 installing-noweb-in-openbsd.md
d-rwxr-xr-x M 0 ncb ncb      0 Aug  5 15:47 ncb.ar
</code></pre>

<p>The list above is a list of files and directories (the latter beign just a
kind of file). The most important part of every item, concerning security, are
the ownership and the permissions flags:</p>

<pre><code>--rw-r--r-- ncb ncb      installing-noweb-in-openbsd.md
d-rwxr-xr-x ncb ncb      ncb.ar
</code></pre>

<p>The second and third columns say that the <code>ncb</code> user and the <code>ncb</code> group own
the file.</p>

<p>The first column is a string of flags which say who can <code>read</code>, <code>open</code> or
<code>execute</code> the file. The first flag in the first row above, (<code>-</code>) indicates
that <code>installing-noweb-in-openbsd.md</code> is a normal file; the second row says
that <code>ncb.ar</code> is a directory (<code>d</code>).</p>

<p>The last three triplets set the owner <code>user</code>, <code>group</code> owner and <code>other</code> users
permissions. Letters <code>r</code>, <code>w</code> and <code>x</code> denote <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> and <code>execute</code>:</p>

<pre><code>--rw-r--r-- ncb ncb      installing-noweb-in-openbsd.md
d-rwxr-xr-x ncb ncb      ncb.ar
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the user <code>ncb</code> can <code>r</code>ead and <code>w</code>rite the <code>installing-noweb-in-
openbsd.md</code> file but it can&#8217;t e<code>x</code>ecute it. The <code>d</code> in the beginning of the
second row implies that the file is a directory; the execution permission in a
directory means it can be opened.</p>

<p>If all resources the operating system provides are exported through the file 
system, the same mechanism could be used to provide security.</p>

<p>For example, if the user attempting to launch a process permissions to open and write into 
<code>&#47;proc</code>, creating a process from an executable file could be done by:</p>

<pre><code>cp a.out &#47;proc&#47;user&#47;
</code></pre>

<p>By turning everything into a file system, all the different interfaces and permissions
merge into the file system. The programmer doesn&#8217;t need to learn other system
calls and their permissions and restrictions. Libraries would also be
simplified, since many syscalls would just be familiar operations on
files.</p>

<p>Another interesting application would be to restrict a process capabilities. The 
way to achive it today is to use containers or virtual machines, or if security 
is not a concern, a chroot. (OpenBSD created another method: 
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge">pledge</a>).
If a system call is migrated into an object in the filesystem, usual file permissions could
restrict access to it.</p>
