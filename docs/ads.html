<p>Notes some algorithms and data structures.</p>

<h2 id="binary-search-trees">binary search trees</h2>

<p>A tree where each node value is bigger than the value of the left child and smaller or equal than the one on the right.</p>

<pre><code>          5
         &#47; \
        4   6
       &#47; \
      3  2
</code></pre>

<p>The invariant applies recursively to the subtrees rooted in each child.</p>

<p>The ordering of the tree allows fast search and insert, in <code>O(log(n))</code>, where <code>n</code> is the amount of elements.</p>

<p>Insert:</p>

<pre><code>insert v in tree T:
  if T is empty
    return a tree with a single node with value v

  if T.value &#62; v
    if T.left is empty
      create node with value v in T.left
      return
    insert v on T.left
  else
    if T.right is empty
      create node with value v in T.right
      return
    insert v on T.right
</code></pre>

<p>Search:</p>

<pre><code>search value v in tree T:
  if T is empty
    return false
  if T.value == v
    return true

  if T.value &#60;= v
    return search v in Tree.right

  else
    return search v in Tree.left
</code></pre>

<h2 id="avl">avl</h2>

<p>An example of a balanced binary search tree. To the properties of a <em>binary search tree</em>, this structure adds balancing: the difference in heights of the trees from any node is bounded by 1 and -1. In that way, searching elements within the tree grows in proportion to its height, logarithmicaly.</p>

<p>The cost is an increase in the implementation complexity, but not that much.</p>

<p>The usual operations performed in these trees are, like in BST&#8217;s:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>insert</code></li>
<li><code>delete</code></li>
<li><code>search</code></li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>A possible structure to implement a <em>node</em>:</p>

<pre><code>Node:
    heigth: height of the tree rooted in this node
    right_tree: reference to the right tree
    left_tree: reference to the left tree
    parent: reference to the parent node
    value: value
</code></pre>

<p>To mantain a balance in the left and right branch height, each node has a <em>balance factor</em>. It is computed by:</p>

<pre><code>bf(node) = node.right_tree.height - node.left_tree.height
</code></pre>

<p>The invariant of the tree, adding to those of a normal BST, is that the balance factor of every node is 1, 0 or -1.</p>

<p>When inserting or deleting a node the balance factor may change, resulting in an inbalanced tree. A set of operations, called <em>rotations</em>, can fix them:</p>

<pre><code>      X[-2]                   Z[0]
      &#47;    \                 &#47;   \ 
   Y[1]   Xr   rotation     Y     X
   &#47;  \        --------&#62;   &#47; \   &#47; \
  Yl   Z                  Yl Zl Zr  Xr
       &#47; \
     Zl  Zr

     X[2]                   Y[0 or 1]
    &#47; \                       &#47; \
  Xl   Y[1]    rotation      X   Z
       &#47; \     --------&#62;    &#47; \
    Yl   Z                 Xl  Yl
         &#47; \
       Zl  Zr
</code></pre>

<p>([] holds the balance factor)</p>

<p>There are two other rotations which are symmetrical whith the above.</p>

<h2 id="b-tree">b-tree</h2>

<p>A tree with the invariant (taken from aocp vol III ed.2 p.483):</p>

<ul>
<li>every node has at most m children</li>
<li>except for the root and leaves, nodes have at least <code>m&#47;2</code> children</li>
<li>the root has at least 2 children (unless is a leaf)</li>
<li>all leaves appear on the same level and carry no information</li>
<li>a non-leaf node with <code>k</code> children contains <code>k-1</code> keys</li>
</ul>
